      "question": "I wonder how many accidents I’ve had in my life. I’ve had a few serious ones where I’ve ended up in hospital. Traffic accidents are the worst. They’re always painful. I haven’t had too many work-related accidents. I suppose that’s because I do office work and that’s not so dangerous. Most of my accidents are those around the house. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve hit my thumb with a hammer. I’m also really good at standing up and hitting my head on something. I’m not as bad as my friend though. He’s a real accident looking for somewhere to happen. Almost every time we meet, he has some story to tell about his latest accident. He’s quite unbelievable. I think I’d be very worried if I were his mother.",
      "answer": "我不知道這輩子經歷過多少次意外。我曾經出過幾次嚴重的意外，最後都進了醫院。交通事故是最糟糕的，總是很痛苦。我沒有遇到太多工作相關的意外。我想那是因為我做的是辦公室工作，沒那麼危險。我大部分的意外都是在家裡發生的。我已經數不清有多少次用錘子敲到自己的拇指了。我也很擅長站起來時撞到頭。不過我沒有我朋友那麼糟。他簡直就是一個四處尋找意外的人。幾乎每次我們見面，他都有關於最新意外的故事要講。他真的很不可思議。如果我是他媽媽，我想我會非常擔心。",

Being a member of the audience at the theatre is great, but acting on stage is better. I wonder what it’s like to be a movie star. I think you need to be beautiful or handsome to be a successful Hollywood or Bollywood actor. They all look great. Actors are very lucky. They get paid huge amounts of money to do what they love doing. My favourite actors are all dead now. I really like the actors in the old black and white movies. They all looked so cool. Actors in the old days seemed to be more glamorous than today’s actors. The best thing about being an actor is that all of your friends are famous too.",
      "answer": "當演員一定很棒。我真希望我會演戲。我很想擁有在人們面前表演的自信。在劇院當觀眾已經很棒了，但在舞台上表演更好。我很好奇當電影明星是什麼感覺。我認為要成為成功的好萊塢或寶萊塢演員，你需要長得漂亮或英俊。他們看起來都很棒。演員們非常幸運。他們做自己喜歡的事情就能賺到大筆的錢。我最喜歡的演員現在都已經過世了。我真的很喜歡老黑白電影裡的演員。他們看起來都很酷。以前的演員似乎比現在的演員更有魅力。當演員最棒的事情是你所有的朋友也都很有名。",

      "question": "What is advertising? Is it telling the truth or is it making things look better than they really are? Or is it lying? Companies pay a lot of money for adverts. Some of the ads you see in glossy magazines look like art. The commercials on TV look like mini movies. Do they really change our behaviour? Do adverts make you buy things? I think some advertising is a form of lying. Is BMW really “The ultimate driving machine” like they say in their ads? British Airways used to say they were “The world’s favourite airline,” but had to stop saying it because it wasn’t true. Personally, I get tired of watching ads on television. They always interrupt a good programme. I like ads in magazines. They’re usually quite interesting.",
      "answer": "什麼是廣告？它是在說真話，還是在把事情描繪得比實際上更好？或者它是在說謊？公司為廣告付出大量的金錢。你在光面雜誌上看到的一些廣告看起來像藝術品。電視上的商業廣告看起來像迷你電影。它們真的會改變我們的行為嗎？廣告會讓你買東西嗎？我認為有些廣告是一種謊言。BMW真的像他們廣告說的那樣是「終極駕駛機器」嗎？英國航空公司曾經說他們是「世界上最受歡迎的航空公司」，但因為這不是真的，他們不得不停止這樣說。就我個人而言，我厭倦了看電視廣告。它們總是打斷好節目。我喜歡雜誌裡的廣告，通常都挺有趣的。",

Listening to advice can be great for helping you make the right decision. The greatest piece of advice I’ve received was from my father. He told me I can do anything in life if I try hard. He was right. I am now passing on his advice to my own children. Right now I need some advice on money. My financial advisors are telling me to be very careful. That’s very sound advice. I would advise anyone to do the same. Someone asked me the other day about the worst piece of advice I’ve ever had. I couldn’t answer. I don’t think I’ve had any really bad advice.",

I like playing with the in-flight entertainment system, especially now they have all the latest movies. I also love airplane food. Many of my friends say it’s disgusting, but I love it. I often ask the passenger next to me if I can have the dessert or roll they don’t want. The only thing I don’t like about planes is turbulence. When the airplane hits those air pockets, I always worry we’ll crash. But I once read that turbulence has never caused an airplane to crash.",

It seems like you walk across a town by the time you check in and get to your departure gate. The thing I like most about airports is people watching. There are people from all over the world. I also like how everything fits and works together. You check your luggage in and then it disappears, before you see it again at the next airport. I still think airports need improving. There’s not a lot to do there. Airports really need to have an entertainment area so people can kill time.",
      "answer": "機場不是很奇怪的地方嗎？裡面發生著這麼多事情。有人來，有人走；有人因為要離開而傷心哭泣，有人因為到達而喜極而泣。大型機場幾乎就像小城鎮。從辦理登機手續到到達登機門，感覺就像穿越了一個城鎮。我最喜歡機場的事情是觀察人群。那裡有來自世界各地的人。我也喜歡一切如何配合和運作。你托運行李，然後它消失了，直到你在下一個機場再次看到它。我仍然認為機場需要改進。那裡沒有太多事情可做。機場真的需要有一個娛樂區，讓人們可以打發時間。",

I drank when I was much younger, but I haven’t touched a drop for years. I hated hangovers so I decided to stop drinking altogether. I have a much better time without alcohol. people say they need to drink to relax. They drink and just act and look stupid. Their face goes red and they can’t walk in a straight line. Alcohol is also the most damaging drug in society. That’s what I think, anyway. Alcohol causes many illnesses, traffic accidents, fights and domestic violence. If you banned alcohol, people would be healthier, richer and have a better family life.",
      "answer": "我討厭酒精。我真的不理解人們怎麼會喝酒，或為什麼要喝酒。人們呼吸中的酒精味令人噁心。它很貴，還會讓你頭痛。我年輕時喝過酒，但已經好幾年滴酒未沾了。我討厭宿醉，所以決定完全戒酒。沒有酒精我過得更開心。人們說他們需要喝酒來放鬆。他們喝了酒後行為舉止看起來都很蠢。他們的臉變紅，走路都走不直。酒精也是社會中最具破壞性的毒品。反正這是我的看法。酒精會導致許多疾病、交通事故、打架和家庭暴力。如果你禁止酒精，人們會更健康、更富有，家庭生活也會更好。",

I also don’t think they look like us. But I’m sure they exist. I just don’t think we’ll ever see any or find any. They live too far away. If you think about it logically, there has to be aliens out there. All a planet needs is to be warm and have water and life will exist. There are billions and billions of planets in the universe, so there are probably millions and millions that have life. Alien life. It’s also likely that some of the aliens are much more intelligent than we are. I wonder what we’d do if really intelligent aliens visited Earth. What would we ask them?",

I knew all the different animal species. The most exciting thing for me was going to the zoo. I would spend hours just watching the animals walk around, sit, or even sleep. When I was older, I went on a safari to Tanzania. I saw real wild animals in the wild. Everyone should do this once in their lives. Looking at animals in their natural habitat is a real honour. Now I’m worried about the future of many animals. Some of my favourite animals are in danger of dying out. We really need to change our lifestyle so our children can have the chance of seeing animals in the wild.",

How is it possible for a cream or lotion to stop us looking old? I don't think any skincare goods can make us look younger. I certainly don't believe cosmetics companies that say their expensive creams can remove wrinkles. They just want to make lots of money. Why do people believe them? How do they know their creams work? They did not test their products on thousands of people over 50 years. I think if a person uses an anti-aging cream for 50 years, they would not even look a year younger when they are 60. This means it's a huge waste of money. Only healthy living can keep us looking younger.",

I don’t think it’s good for so many people to live so close together. It’s not good for people to live on top of each other. I don’t understand how people can live above the second floor. It’s not natural to live in the sky. The thing I hate most about apartments are the lifts (Americans say elevator) and the fact there’s no garden. More and more people are moving into apartments. This creates problems with overcrowding. There aren’t enough spaces to park your car, there’s nowhere to throw your rubbish and you have to wait ages to reach your floor. Give me a little house with a little garden any day.",
      "answer": "在美國，它們被稱為公寓（apartments）；在英國它們被稱為公寓（flats）。它們是現代的發明。我並不特別喜歡它們。我認為這麼多人住在一起不太好。人們住在彼此頭上不是件好事。我不明白人們怎麼能住在二樓以上。住在天空中是不自然的。我最討厭公寓的是電梯（英國人說lift，美國人說elevator）和沒有花園這個事實。越來越多的人搬進公寓。這造成了過度擁擠的問題。沒有足夠的停車位，沒有地方扔垃圾，而且你必須等很久才能到達你的樓層。隨時給我一棟帶小花園的小房子吧。",

I would like to fill my house with art from all over the world. It’s interesting to see how different cultures have different kinds of art. There’s nothing better than visiting art galleries when you go to another country. I prefer more traditional art. I don’t really understand a lot of modern art.

I love the changing of the leaves. The different autumn colours are one of nature’s most beautiful scenes. Sometimes I can’t stop looking at the mountains near my house. They are like an artist’s palette of golds, reds, yellows, browns and other autumnal colours. In America they call autumn ‘fall’ because that is when the leaves fall from the trees. I like the coolness of autumn. Summer is over but you can still wear a T-shirt – just about. You can also spend hours outdoors without sweating. Autumn is the best time of the year to go hiking and go for long walks.",

Why do we think some things or some people are beautiful and others aren’t? Some people think a building is beautiful, while others think the opposite. People nowadays spend too much time and money on beauty. I agree with the expression, “beauty is only skin deep”. This means that what’s really important is someone’s heart and character, not what they look like on the outside.

Of course, being married also has many wonderful sides to it. You have a lifelong friend who will love you forever. You share many wonderful times together and support each other through good and bad times. And you grow old together and look back on years of happy memories. I think being married is great for your soul.",

      "question": "Being single has its advantages and disadvantages. I think it’s better to stay single when you’re young. You need to live and have fun. You also need the freedom to do what you want, when you want. Being single in your twenties gives you lots of time to go travelling, see the world and experience different things. Most people like being single in their twenties and then want to settle down in their thirties. I think being single later in life can be sad. All of your friends are married or attached and people tend to go out and party less. I think being single when you’re old would be very lonely. The longer you stay single, the harder it becomes to settle down. In some countries, people think you’re strange if you’re single later on in life.",
      "answer": "單身有優點也有缺點。我認為年輕時最好保持單身。你需要生活和玩樂。你也需要自由，想做什麼就做什麼，想什麼時候做就什麼時候做。二十多歲時單身可以讓你有很多時間去旅行、看世界和體驗不同的事物。大多數人在二十多歲時喜歡單身，然後在三十多歲時想要安定下來。我認為人生後期單身可能會很悲傷。你所有的朋友都結婚了或有伴侶，人們外出和派對的次數也減少了。我認為老了以後單身會非常孤獨。你單身的時間越長，就越難安定下來。在一些國家，如果你在人生後期還是單身，人們會認為你很奇怪。",

I’m sure I’d be ten times busier than now if I didn’t have a computer. Imagine having to find a piece of paper and an envelope and then walking down the street to mail a letter! I love my computer. It makes everything in my life so convenient. Sure, it freezes and crashes sometimes. Sure I lose some data. But that’s not often. Most of the time my computer is like my best friend.",

      "question": "Would you like to change your face and body? Would you like movie star looks? A lot of people want to do this. They pay lots of money to go to a cosmetic surgeon and change their appearance. The most common operation we call a nose job. People who are unhappy with their nose have it reshaped. Other people want their wrinkles to disappear to make themselves look younger. People also go under the knife and have things made bigger or smaller. I think this is a waste of money. I'm not the best-looking person in the world but I would never consider plastic surgery - even if it was free. Some people have so many operations they end up looking like they’re  made of plastic. I'd rather stay looking human.",

The really expensive cosmetics don’t actually make you look that different than really cheap ones. A lot depends too on your skill – choosing the right colours to match your face, and how you put your make-up on. I sometimes laugh at the ladies selling cosmetics in department stores. They’re meant to be experts but they look like clowns. I mean, do they really need to paint their faces? One thing I worry about is whether the chemicals damage your skin.",

They keep you company, they bark if a stranger comes near your house, and they fetch your slippers. Not all dogs are nice, though. Some are dangerous. I get sad when I read in the paper about children being attacked by a dog. Owners need to train them better. I also get sad when I read about abandoned dogs. People who want a dog as a pet should get an abandoned one.",

They even have problems trying to buy shoes that fit them. My feet are pretty normal. They’ve been very useful down the years. I’ve done a lot of running, loads of hiking and played thousands of hours of football. I’ve never injured my feet or my ankles. I sometimes get sore feet when I go shopping. That seems to be the only thing my feet don’t like. That and new shoes. New shoes usually give me blistered feet. Oh yes… and the cold. My feet hate the cold. My toes go numb. Especially my big toe. One thing I’m happy about is that I don’t have smelly feet.",
      "answer": "有些人喜歡自己的腳，而有些人則不然。我還挺喜歡我的腳的。它們不大也不小。我認識的一些人腳非常大，甚至在買鞋時會遇到困難。我的腳算是相當正常，多年來一直很有用。我跑過很多步，爬過不少山，還踢過數千小時的足球。我從來沒有傷過我的腳或腳踝。有時候我在購物時會感到腳酸，那似乎是我腳唯一不喜歡的事情，還有新鞋。新鞋通常會讓我腳起水泡。哦，對了……還有寒冷。我的腳非常討厭寒冷，特別是我的大腳趾會變得麻木。有一件事讓我感到高興，那就是我沒有臭腳。",

I think I’m good at judging someone’s character from the first time I set eyes on them. It’s easy to understand if the person is my kind of person. First impressions count most when you meet someone important. If you have a job interview, it’s very important to give a good first impression. The interviewer can decide if they like you as soon as you walk through the door. Are you well-dressed? Do you look happy? Do you greet the interviewer? All these things are important. I also think first impressions count when you meet your future in-laws.",
      "answer": "人們常說，第一印象很重要。你怎麼看？你能從第一次見到或認識某人時了解很多關於他們的事情嗎？我認為我能夠從第一次見到某人時就判斷他們的性格。很容易就能看出這個人是否是我喜歡的類型。當你遇到重要的人時，第一印象尤其重要。如果你有一場工作面試，給人留下良好的第一印象非常關鍵。面試官在你走進門的那一刻就能決定他們是否喜歡你。你穿著得體嗎？你看起來快樂嗎？你有向面試官打招呼嗎？這些都是重要的因素。我也認為，當你見到未來的岳父岳母時，第一印象同樣重要。",

I don’t have a favourite fish. I must confess that after watching the movie ‘Finding Nemo’ I do now like clownfish. As well as looking at fish, I also love eating them. Tuna is my favourite, especially raw tuna. When I visit Japan, the first thing I do is go to a sushi restaurant. Raw fish is so much tastier than cooked fish. And probably a lot healthier.",

They even get up at four o’clock in the morning in the winter to sit in the freezing cold. They say the best time to fish is before the sun comes up. I say they’re crazy. Big game fishing looks good.

That’s a little worrying.",
      "answer": "當我還是個孩子的時候，我覺得黑幫非常酷。我喜歡看黑幫電影。阿爾·卡彭對我來說幾乎就像是一位英雄。我總是希望電影中的黑幫能逃脫警察的追捕。這些電影讓黑幫看起來像英雄。現在我長大了，我覺得這真是令人震驚。怎麼可以美化黑幫的生活呢？當然，我們都知道黑幫是危險的。他們涉及許多罪行，販賣毒品、販賣兒童和經營賣淫集團。許多黑幫控制著政治家和警察。事實上，在世界上許多國家，黑幫甚至成為了政治家。有趣的是，即使現在，當我看黑幫電影時，我仍然覺得黑幫是好人。這讓人有點擔憂。",

It’s one of the most relaxing hobbies I can think of. It’s also very satisfying. I get very excited about gardening. I love planting seeds and then letting nature take over. It’s amazing how quickly things grow. Before you know it, your seeds are beautiful flowers. You also learn a lot about flowers, vegetables, shrubs and trees. Of course, gardening is also very practical. If you grow vegetables, you can eat what you grow. Vegetables picked fresh from your garden really do taste better than the ones in the shops. Gardening is good for you. It makes you feel part of the Earth.",

We could end up creating a Frankenstein’s monster. The idea of genetic engineering has been around for centuries. Scientists have always wanted to change us. The real breakthrough came in the latter half of last century. Geneticists cracked the genetic code and found ways of altering our genes. Now they can clone animals and reproduce human tissue and organs. I don’t think it’ll be too long before scientists clone a person. Once all the fuss has died down, younger generations will be more accepting of genetic engineering. We might even live to be two hundred years old.",

      "question": "A hangover is one of the worst feelings you can have. There’s nothing you can do to make it go away. You just have to wait for it to wear off. It usually takes a whole day and can even take two days to disappear. The most stupid thing about a hangover is that you never learn. A hangover is your body’s warning that too much alcohol is bad for you. When something is painful, you never do it again. Not so with a hangover. When people have a hangover, they often drink again the next day. This makes your original hangover much worse. Many people have their own hangover “cure”. None of them work for me. All I can do is suffer. I suppose the best thing for a hangover is not to drink at all, or at least not drink too much.",
      "answer": "宿醉是你能體驗到的最糟糕的感覺之一。你無法做任何事情讓它消失。你只能耐心等待它慢慢過去。這通常需要整整一天，甚至可能需要兩天才能消失。宿醉最愚蠢的地方在於你從來不會學到教訓。宿醉是你身體對過量飲酒的警告。當某件事情讓你感到痛苦時，你通常不會再去做。但宿醉卻不是這樣。當人們宿醉時，往往會在第二天再次飲酒。這會讓你原本的宿醉變得更加嚴重。許多人都有自己的宿醉“解藥”。但對我來說，沒有一種有效。我所能做的就是忍受。我想，對於宿醉來說，最好的辦法就是根本不喝酒，或者至少不要喝太多。",

The most important thing for Bhutan’s government is how happy the people are. What a fantastic idea this is. Imagine if governments focused on making us all happy. They could spend money on beaches and free ice cream instead of fighting wars. I looked at everyone on the train this morning. No one looked happy. Maybe the news should be full of happy stories instead of the usual doom and gloom.",
      "answer": "快樂就是坐在海灘上，手裡拿著一本好書，並且一年內不必工作和學習。啊……如果能如此就好了。你心目中的快樂是什麼？這是一件非常重要的事情。我喜歡不丹的理念（不丹是緊鄰尼泊爾的小國）。在那裡，他們更願意衡量快樂而非金錢。不丹政府最關心的就是人民的快樂程度。這真是一個奇妙的想法。想像一下，如果各國政府都專注於讓我們每個人都快樂，那麼他們就可以把錢花在海灘和免費冰淇淋上，而不是打仗。今天早上我在火車上看著每個人，沒有人看起來快樂。也許新聞應該充滿快樂的故事，而不是一如既往的悲觀與陰霾。",

Just look at what’s happened since the 9/11 attacks in New York. Hate has increased in the world and the media seems to fuel this. I’m glad I live in a country that has laws against hate crime.

      "question": "I think being a housewife is a very demanding job. Most housewives have a lot to do, especially if they have children. Of course, some have an easy time because they have a maid or a tiny house. Most housewives though are working pretty much from the time they wake up to the time they go to bed. They have to get up the earliest to cook everyone’s breakfast. Then they have to do the dishes, start the washing, iron and then go shopping to buy the food. Before their children go to school, the housewife has to make their packed lunches. I reckon cooking three meals a day every single day can be pretty tiring. Afternoons are just as busy, and then it all starts again when everyone comes home from school and work!",
      "answer": "我認為家庭主婦是一份非常繁重的工作。大多數家庭主婦有很多事情要做，尤其是如果她們有孩子的話。當然，有些人因為有保姆或住在小房子裡而輕鬆一些。不過，大多數家庭主婦幾乎從早上起床到晚上睡覺都在忙碌。她們必須最早起床為大家準備早餐。然後，她們要洗碗、開始洗衣服、熨燙衣物，接著去購物買食材。在孩子上學之前，家庭主婦還得為他們準備午餐。我想，每天三餐的烹飪工作實在是相當累人。下午同樣忙碌，當大家從學校和工作回家時，所有的忙碌又重新開始了！",

I think government leaders should know about this. A lot of them don’t care much about human rights. I can’t believe it’s the twenty-first century and human rights is still an issue in pretty much all of the world’s countries. The most powerful countries even attack each other for abusing human rights. I hope one day that all human rights are respected. That will be paradise.",

Our sense of humour develops as we grow up. Some people become very good at telling jokes. I always find it difficult to remember jokes. I don’t understand jokes from other countries.

You can’t pass a single day without hearing someone say ‘love’. It is one of the most beautiful words in any language. Your heart can melt when someone says, ‘I love you’.

They think the government is trying to control us too much. I’m not sure that’s true, but it is something to think about. In this day and age, when immigration is a problem, I think ID cards might be useful. Some countries are using ID cards as a one-stop card for everything. The card is your driving license, medical card and ID all rolled into one. That’s a great idea. All we need now is to make it a passport and credit card.",
      "answer": "我對身份證的看法有些猶豫。身份證有好有壞，但我認為整體來說它們是有益的。這取決於政府如何使用這些資訊，也取決於保存我們資訊的資料庫有多安全。許多人認為身份證過於繁瑣，覺得政府試圖對我們進行過度控制。我不確定這是否真實，但這確實是值得思考的。在當今這個移民問題突出的時代，我認為身份證可能會派上用場。一些國家將身份證作為一種一站式的卡片，涵蓋所有功能。這張卡既是你的駕駛執照、醫療卡，也是身份證，三合一的設計真是個好主意。現在我們只需要將它變成護照和信用卡即可。",

A long time ago I heard the vegetarian slogan “Meat is Murder”. If you think about it, that’s true. I don’t think animals are here today for us to eat, especially when we don’t need to eat meat. And then there’s the threat of global warming today. Raising animals needs land. Many forests are cut down to raise cows for meat. This really has to stop.

      "answer": "多元文化主義如今無處不在。隨著世界變得越來越小，多元文化主義也變得越來越重要。今天，少有人生活在只有一種文化的小鎮上。我們生活在周圍充滿了許多其他文化的小鎮。如果我們生活在城市裡，將會看到來自世界各地的人們。當然，有些城市的多元文化程度比其他城市更高。紐約是一個真正的熔爐，被稱為地球上最具多元文化的城市。而像東京這樣的城市則不那麼多元文化。我認為多元文化主義是一件美好的事情。走出家門就能看到其他文化，這真是太棒了。這在我年輕的時候是無法想像的。人們對其他文化缺乏理解，甚至不想去理解。我很高興今天的情況正在改變。",

Even worse are people who commit multi-murder. Mass killing seems to be more and more common today. Shootings at schools are especially bad. How can we prevent murder? Every time we look at the news, there’s another murder. I hope it is not something that will stay with the human race forever.  What is the correct punishment for murder? In some societies it is just a few years in prison. In others it is the death penalty. But there are some countries that don’t punish people for murder. If you are in power and are rich, you can literally get away with murder.",

Athletes work on the specific muscles they need for their sport. If you look at a hundred-metre runner, you’ll notice they have large shoulder and arm muscles. This is so they can power ahead when they run. An interesting thing about muscles is that it takes more face muscles to frown than it does to smile. This means smiling uses less energy, so we should do it more.",

      "question": "Nuclear weapons are the worst thing invented by man. The day we invented them was a black day in our history. Fortunately, they have only been used a few times. We only need to read the history of what happened in Japan to understand why nuclear weapons must never be used again. The Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed in an instant. Hundreds of thousands died. Today, nuclear weapons are a hundred times more powerful. It’s scary to think how much harm one nuclear bomb could cause. Even scarier, is what happens if terrorists get hold of nuclear weapons. I fear for our future. One day, all countries will have nuclear weapons and then we’ll be in real trouble.",
      "answer": "核武器是人類發明的最糟糕的東西。我們發明它們的那一天，是我們歷史上的黑暗日子。幸運的是，它們只被使用過幾次。我們只需閱讀日本發生的歷史，就能理解為什麼核武器絕不能再次使用。日本的廣島和長崎瞬間被摧毀，數十萬人喪生。如今，核武器的威力是當年的百倍。想想一枚核彈可能造成的傷害，令人毛骨悚然。更可怕的是，如果恐怖分子掌握了核武器，會發生什麼。對於我們的未來，我感到擔憂。總有一天，所有國家都會擁有核武器，那時我們將面臨真正的麻煩。",

We live in a house and a street that has a number. We communicate with each other using telephone numbers. We worry about how small or big the numbers are on our bank statements. We can’t survive without numbers. Most of the world cannot function without the numbers zero and one. These are the two numbers computers use to run their programmes. I don’t think numbers were always so important. Maybe 500 years ago, we only had to remember the number of sheep, goats or children we had. I wonder how many numbers we need today!",
      "answer": "停下來想一想，數字對我們生活的重要性有多大。數字控制著我們。事實上，我們就是數字。我們有護照號碼、社會安全號碼、身份證號碼等等。我們住在有編號的房子和街道上。我們用電話號碼彼此溝通。我們擔心銀行對賬單上的數字是多麼的小或大。我們無法在沒有數字的情況下生存。世界上大多數地方在沒有零和一的情況下無法運行。這兩個數字是電腦運行其程序所需的。我不認為數字一直如此重要。也許五百年前，我們只需要記住擁有的羊、山羊或孩子的數量。我想知道今天我們需要多少個數字！",

They do such a valuable job but get paid less than politicians. This is not right. Politicians do whatever they can to take our money. They even vote to stop nurses getting increases in pay. This is wrong. Governments need to do more to help nurses. There should be a bigger focus on the profession. I would much rather have more nurses than more weapons. A few years ago I wanted to get into nursing. I met some nurses who told me not to. They said the job involved too many hours, too much paperwork and not enough pay. That’s sad. We can’t afford to treat nurses so badly.",
      "answer": "護理是世界上最偉大的職業之一。它的重要性遠超過大多數工作。令人難過的是，護士的薪水卻如此之低。他們所做的工作是如此有價值，但卻比政治人物的薪水還要低。這是不對的。政治人物為了掠奪我們的錢財不擇手段，甚至投票阻止護士加薪。這是錯誤的。政府需要做更多來幫助護士。應該更加重視這個職業。我寧願有更多的護士，而不是更多的武器。幾年前，我曾想進入護理行業。我遇到了一些護士，他們告訴我不要這麼做。他們說這份工作需要太多的工時、太多的文書工作，卻沒有足夠的薪水。這真令人難過。我們無法承受如此不公地對待護士。",

They become lazy and eat fast food. They also forget about exercise and sit in front of the TV instead. The worrying thing is that more and more children are suffering from obesity. This is a big problem. The number of overweight kids I see today is amazing. I think the reason is quite simple – junk food, video games and the Internet. When I was growing up, I had a balanced diet. I also spent most of my free time outdoors. I spent hours every day on my bike or playing football. Kids today hardly go outside. They are glued to one kind of screen or another – TV, computer or games console.",
      "answer": "肥胖問題在全球越來越嚴重，尤其對富裕國家影響深遠。當人們有錢時，他們往往會購買許多不健康的食物，變得懶惰，選擇快餐。他們也忘記了運動，反而坐在電視前。更令人擔憂的是，越來越多的孩子正在遭受肥胖的困擾，這是一個大問題。我今天看到的超重孩子的數量令人驚訝。我認為原因相當簡單——垃圾食品、電子遊戲和互聯網。在我成長的過程中，我的飲食是均衡的。我也大部分時間都在戶外活動，每天花幾個小時騎自行車或踢足球。而如今的孩子幾乎不會走出家門，他們總是黏在某個屏幕前——無論是電視、電腦還是遊戲機。",

They are responsible for weather patterns and a lot of the world’s foods. The problem is, they are becoming very polluted. Many fish species are in danger of dying. The coral reefs in our oceans are also in danger. We really need to think more about our oceans. We have to protect the life in them, or we might die. I love the ocean.

This is one of the biggest causes of global warming. There isn’t much oil left in the ground. Some people say it will all be gone this century. I suppose that means we won’t make as much pollution. But what will we do when the oil runs out? Scientists are working on that right now. We need to do something because we use oil to power our cars, homes and factories. Whatever we replace oil with must be better for the environment. I don’t think oil-producing countries are happy their oil will run out. They need to start thinking about how to make money after the oil has gone.",
      "answer": "石油有好有壞。它的好處在於能滿足我們的能源需求，而壞處則在於它會造成污染。石油是一種化石燃料，燃燒它會產生二氧化碳（CO2），這是全球暖化的主要原因之一。地球上剩下的石油不多了，有些人認為在這個世紀內它將會耗盡。我想這意味著我們的污染不會那麼嚴重。但當石油用完時，我們該怎麼辦？科學家們正在努力解決這個問題。我們需要採取行動，因為我們依賴石油來驅動汽車、供應家庭和工廠的能源。我們用來替代石油的東西必須對環境更友好。我不認為產油國會對石油耗盡感到高興，他們需要開始思考在石油消失後如何賺錢。",

Is it a word or is at an abbreviation? We spell it ‘okay’ but abbreviate it as ‘OK’. I wonder how many meanings it has. You can ask if someone is OK, if they are ill; you can ask if someone understands a question or instructions using OK; you can even let someone know ‘enough is enough’ by saying OK. If you say something is OK, it means you don’t really like or dislike it. In fact, sometimes, if you say, “He’s OK” or “She’s OK, it means you don’t really like them. I think okay is also a verb. I have heard people say, “It’s OK, John okayed it”.",

      "answer": "我所在的城鎮公園實在太少了。我不知道為什麼。我覺得這非常糟糕。我認為最大的原因是貪婪的房地產開發商。人們更關心如何從辦公大樓中賺錢，而不是打造一個宜居的城鎮。我們需要公園。我們的孩子需要一個可以玩耍的地方。許多人住在公寓裡，沒有花園，這意味著我們需要公園。如果城市規劃者不建設公園，那麼他們的工作就不會很好。當我年輕的時候，公園到處都是。孩子們可以盡情地跑來跑去。那裡有大片的草地。我們踢足球和玩其他遊戲。但這些都不復存在了。現在，曾經的公園變成了購物中心和停車場。如今，孩子們在購物中心裡玩耍。這樣可不好。",

Look around you and count how many things you see or have or are wearing that are made of plastic. One day, we’ll need to find a replacement for plastic. That’s because oil will run out and plastic is made from oil. Maybe in the future there’ll be plastic museums full of valuable plastic. People will buy antique plastic.

      "answer": "他們稱賣淫為世界上最古老的職業。這很有趣，因為在世界上大多數國家，這是非法的。怎麼能把非法的東西稱為職業呢？賣淫應該是非法的嗎？如果一個男人或女人想要出售自己的身體，那又有什麼問題呢？每個政府都知道這在他們的國家發生。即使是規定最嚴格的國家也有賣淫的存在。許多政府只是對此視而不見。將其定為非法的問題在於，女性性工作者受到傷害。她們沒有法律保護，因此她們的工作變得非常危險。在荷蘭，賣淫是合法的。性工作者必須定期接受健康檢查，並且如果遇到麻煩可以報警。這似乎更為合理。",

Even \"democratic\" countries don't appear to like people protesting in the streets. Some innocent people who just wanted to change things for the better die.

The people who appear in reality TV shows have no talent. There is nothing you can learn from these shows. TV companies must be really short of ideas, or money. I can’t think of a bigger waste of time than looking at a group of people in a room together, and seeing how they get on or don’t get on. I’m amazed they are so popular.

And then you put salad dressing on top to make it extra yummy. Salads just look so healthy, and you feel healthy after eating them. I like all kinds of salad. There are so many, from pasta salads to potato salad to a simple green salad. They’re all tasty and healthy.",
      "answer": "沙拉是很重要的。我想大多數人都吃得不夠沙拉。我們更喜歡其他食物。對於沙拉，我有點懶惰。我懶得自己做。如果我在餐廳的沙拉吧，我會努力去製作。我會把能放的東西都堆在我的盤子上。吃沙拉是非常健康的。我真的必須努力每天吃兩到三次沙拉。我認為如果每個人都這樣做，整個世界會更健康。有這麼多美味的沙拉蔬菜。然後再加上沙拉醬，讓它更加美味。沙拉看起來就是那麼健康，吃完後你也會感覺健康。我喜歡各種沙拉。有很多種，從意大利麵沙拉到馬鈴薯沙拉，再到簡單的綠色沙拉。它們都美味又健康。",

It’s funny. There’s a lot to smile about. If you smile a lot, it shows you like life and are easy to get on with. People who do not smile are difficult to be with. I often smile to myself when I’m on my own. Walking in a garden or looking at children can make me smile. I always smile when I meet new people, but not everyone smiles back. Smiling is very important to me.",
      "answer": "微笑不是我們生活中最美好的事情嗎？我們需要更多的微笑。如果我走進一家商店，看到店員微笑，我會感到非常快樂。如果每個人都能微笑，這個世界將會變得更加美好。不幸的是，並不是每個人都會微笑。我認識的一些不快樂的人總是問：「有什麼好微笑的？」每當我聽到這句話時，我總是微笑，因為這很有趣。其實有很多值得微笑的事情。如果你經常微笑，這表明你喜歡生活，並且容易相處。不微笑的人則很難相處。我經常在獨處時對自己微笑。走在花園裡或看著孩子們都能讓我微笑。我在遇見新朋友時總是微笑，但並不是每個人都會回以微笑。微笑對我來說非常重要。",

All those eyes and legs and bodies. They make me shiver just thinking about them. Spiders are useful though. They are good at tidying up their environment.",
      "answer": "蜘蛛真的很可怕。我不在乎別人怎麼說，它們就是可怕的生物。有些人說他們喜歡蜘蛛，我覺得他們瘋了。他們之所以喜歡蜘蛛，只是因為它們太小了。如果蜘蛛有大型犬那麼大，人們可不會這麼喜歡它們。你能想像如果它們那麼大會怎樣嗎？我們會遇上大麻煩。蜘蛛是世界上最危險的物種之一。它們擁有數百種致命的毒素，能夠殺死比自己大十倍的生物。如果你仔細觀察蜘蛛，它們真的看起來像可怕的怪物。那些眼睛、腿和身體，光是想想就讓我不寒而慄。不過，蜘蛛也是有用的。它們在整理自己的環境方面非常擅長。",

I love Japan’s national sport sumo. It is one of the most exciting sports in the world. You have to spend a little time getting to know the rules and the fighters.

      "question": "The idea of sweatshops makes me very angry. There’s nothing good about them. Very young children have to work in horrible factories that are bad for their health. They eat and sleep at the factories. Their bosses make them work up to 16 hours a day and sometimes beat them. Not just children, poor people too. The factory owners get rich because of the near slave-labour conditions. The worst thing about sweatshops is that lots of multinational companies buy the clothes and shoes made by the children. Companies like Gap and Nike have been in the news for exploiting children in sweatshops. I think these companies have a big responsibility to make sure their goods do not come from sweatshops.",
      "answer": "剝削工廠的概念讓我非常憤怒。這些地方沒有任何好處。非常年幼的孩子們不得不在對他們健康有害的可怕工廠裡工作。他們在工廠裡吃飯和睡覺。他們的老闆讓他們每天工作長達16小時，有時甚至會打他們。不僅僅是孩子，還有貧窮的人。工廠的老闆因為接近奴隸勞動的條件而變得富有。剝削工廠最糟糕的地方在於，許多跨國公司購買這些孩子製作的衣服和鞋子。像Gap和Nike這樣的公司因為在剝削工廠裡剝削兒童而上了新聞。我認為這些公司有很大的責任，確保他們的產品不來自剝削工廠。",

People in Sweden and Denmark pay very high tax, but then schools, hospitals and other social services are free. Tax there pays for an excellent welfare system. In America, tax is lower but there’s almost no welfare system. Americans have to pay for their own healthcare. If you have no money or insurance, you can’t go to hospital. I don’t mind paying tax, as long as my taxes don’t go to pay for nuclear weapons or fund wars.",

      "answer": "旅遊在過去幾十年中發生了很大的變化。事實上，這是一個相對較新的現象。五十年前，旅遊可能並不存在。那時候，唯一出行的人是富人，他們被稱為旅行者。我想旅遊是在六十年代末和七十年代初開始興起的，因為飛機旅行變得便宜。國外旅行的概念突然在數百萬人中變得非常流行。每個人都渴望在夏天享受兩週的陽光。如今，旅遊已經成為一個數十億美元的產業。地球上幾乎沒有一個角落未受到旅遊的影響。遊客的數量也在急劇上升。來自俄羅斯、印度和中國的數百萬人現在都在度假。旅遊確實讓世界變成了一個全球村。我不確定這是好事還是壞事。",

Even if it’s a horrible, cheap, free toy from McDonalds, they love them. The thing that amazes me is how little toys have changed. The same toys are in the shops today as when I was a kid. I guess some toys will never change. There’ll always be Lego and cars and toy telephones. The biggest difference with today’s toys is that many are digital. Today’s toys speak to you and children interact with them more. They’re not so good in the bath, though. I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of toys. I still love going to toy stores and buying them – as presents, of course.",

It’s also very satisfying to know that you are not wasting your time and are helping people who need help. Many of us could and should be out there doing voluntary activities of some kind. So many volunteer organizations need extra hands. It really is easy. Just pick up the phone and offer your services. I think too many of us settle into a lazy lifestyle. We just want to come home and watch TV. Life is much more interesting when you’re a volunteer. I’ve found it really opens your eyes to how some people live. It’s sometimes sad to see how the government lets people down, but at least I’m doing my bit.",

It's when leaders think they have to be strong so they attack another country and kill more civilians than soldiers. That's war today. Generals and presidents always apologize for the loss of innocent lives, but their image as a strong man (or woman) is more important than the suffering and misery their decisions lead to. There are many examples of wars ending or being avoided through talking. But then talking doesn't feed the war machine. Lots of people get rich when their country goes to war. And we learn in our history books that we are \"good\" at war, so it's OK.",

They even warn us if we've made a mistake with grammar. There is also translation software, but that can produce gobbledygook. And then there are new places to write. With mobile phones and sites like Twitter you don't have a lot of space to write.",
      "answer": "我認為寫作是英語中最困難的技能。我不太確定為什麼。有些學生口語表達非常流利，但他們的寫作卻很糟糕。為什麼他們不能假裝自己在說話，然後把所有內容寫下來呢？寫作時你肯定有更多的時間思考。我覺得近年來寫作變得容易了。電腦和互聯網幫助了我們。雖然我認為許多老師會說科技並沒有幫助，但這是事實。我們在打字時有拼寫檢查工具，甚至會提醒我們語法錯誤。此外，還有翻譯軟體，但那可能會產生一些難以理解的內容。而且，現在有了新的寫作平台。隨著手機和像Twitter這樣的網站，你寫作的空間並不多。",

      "question": "Do you like doing writing activities in class? I think they're quite interesting. It's not really like writing. The way we write in my language is different from English. The sentence and paragraph structures are different. My teacher gives us fun activities so we can do writing a bit at a time. Sometimes we brainstorm and write, sometimes we speed write for ten minutes. One of my favourite activities is writing in pairs. We have to agree on what to write. We even have to agree on the spelling and punctuation. That makes us think about the best way. I think this is very good for me. I also like doing online writing activities. It's good to help me practice typing. I need more writing activities.",
      "answer": "你喜歡在課堂上進行寫作活動嗎？我覺得這些活動相當有趣。這其實不完全像寫作。我們的語言與英語的寫作方式有所不同，句子和段落的結構也不一樣。我的老師會給我們一些有趣的活動，讓我們可以逐步進行寫作。有時我們會進行頭腦風暴並寫作，有時則會進行十分鐘的快速寫作。我最喜歡的活動之一是成對寫作。我們必須就寫什麼達成共識，甚至還要一致同意拼寫和標點。這讓我們思考最佳的寫作方式。我覺得這對我非常有幫助。我也喜歡進行線上的寫作活動，這有助於我練習打字。我需要更多的寫作活動。",

      "question": "X-rays are amazing things. They were invented a really long time ago. I think when they were invented, they were real, cutting edge technology. I think a lot of people were amazed they could see photos of the inside of their body. So OK, it's only photos of bones, but still, that was pretty high-tech fifty years ago. Today, we all have X-rays. Even when we go to the dentist, we have X-rays taken of our teeth. Of course, X-rays are not just used in hospitals. Every time we go to an airport we have to pass through an X-ray machine. The security guys can check to see if we have anything dangerous. Recently, I have seen X-ray machines in all kinds of places – even hotels. I even heard they are in schools.",
      "answer": "X光是令人驚奇的東西。它們是在很久以前發明的。我想當它們被發明出來時，真的是尖端科技。我想很多人都對能看到自己身體內部的照片感到驚訝。好吧，這只是骨頭的照片，但在五十年前，這仍然算是相當高科技的。今天，我們每個人都有X光檢查。即使去看牙醫時，我們也會拍攝牙齒的X光片。當然，X光不僅僅用於醫院。每次我們去機場時，都必須通過X光機。安全人員可以檢查我們是否攜帶任何危險物品。最近，我在各種地方都看到了X光機——甚至在酒店。我甚至聽說它們也出現在學校裡。",

      "question": "Xenophobia is a strange word. For a start, it starts with an 'x' but the first sound is 'z'. It also looks strange. But it is a very serious word. There is too much xenophobia in the world today. There is no need for people to fear foreigners. We are all pretty much the same. The world is getting smaller, so we need to learn to live with our neighbours. I can understand why people were xenophobic. Most countries had a long history of fighting wars against their neighbours, so it was probably natural that people didn't like them. Today, however, it seems crazy that you would not like your neighbour, or people on the other side of the world. I hope that within another generation, xenophobia will be a forgotten word.",
      "answer": "仇外心理是一個奇怪的詞。首先，它以「x」開頭，但第一個音卻是「z」。它的外觀也很奇特。然而，這是一個非常嚴肅的詞。當今世界上仇外心理的現象太普遍了。人們不必害怕外國人。我們基本上都是相似的。世界變得越來越小，因此我們需要學會與鄰居和睦相處。我能理解人們為什麼會產生仇外心理。大多數國家都有與鄰國打仗的悠久歷史，因此人們不喜歡他們可能是自然的。然而，今天，對於不喜歡你的鄰居或地球另一端的人，似乎是瘋狂的。我希望在下一代之內，仇外心理將成為一個被遺忘的詞。",

      "question": "I like the word 'yes'. I much prefer hearing it than hearing 'no'. Yes is a very positive word. It means things can go ahead. You always hope the answer will be yes when you ask a question. The biggest question I asked was when I proposed to my wife. I was so happy when she said yes. Other times I like hearing this word is if I ask an interviewer if I got the job. I often say yes when I'm really happy or have done something really difficult. Even if I play a good shot at tennis I say 'yes' to myself. Even though it is a short word, it has many meanings depending on how you say it. You can express so many different emotions using just this word. Sometimes, 'yes' can mean 'no'. I think I say yes more than I say no.",
      "answer": "我喜歡「是」這個字。我更喜歡聽到它，而不是聽到「不」。是是一個非常正面的詞彙，意味著事情可以繼續進行。當你提出問題時，你總是希望答案是「是」。我問過的最大問題就是我向妻子求婚的時候。當她說「是」的時候，我感到無比的幸福。其他時候，我喜歡聽到這個詞，是當我問面試官我是否獲得了工作時。我常常在非常高興或完成了非常困難的事情時說「是」。即使我在網球場上打出了一個好球，我也會對自己說「是」。儘管這是一個簡短的詞，但根據你說的方式，它有許多不同的含義。你可以僅用這個詞表達出許多不同的情感。有時，「是」也可以意味著「不」。我想我說「是」的次數比說「不」的次數多。",

      "question": "People complain a lot about youth, about young people. I think they have for the past 60 years or so. I don't think youth was much of an issue a hundred years ago. Then, young people were just young people. They respected older people, did what they were told and didn't create trouble. Today, however, the word 'youth' often makes us think of badly behaved teenagers. I think it all started with rock and roll. Suddenly young people decided they wanted more independence and could do what they wanted. They rebelled against society. A whole youth culture developed, with youth fashion, youth clubs and music. Today, we have things like youth crime. It would be nice if youth could have a more positive image.",
      "answer": "人們對年輕人抱怨了很多，我想這種情況已經持續了大約六十年。我認為一百年前年輕人並不是什麼問題。那時，年輕人就是年輕人。他們尊重年長者，聽從指示，不會惹麻煩。然而，今天「青年」這個詞常常讓我們想到行為不端的青少年。我認為這一切始於搖滾樂。年輕人突然決定他們想要更多的獨立，想做自己想做的事。他們對社會反叛。一整個青年文化隨之發展，伴隨著青年時尚、青年俱樂部和音樂。如今，我們還面臨著青少年犯罪等問題。如果年輕人能擁有更積極的形象，那該多好啊。",

Most of the time they are in tiny cages. They must miss the wild. I think animals need freedom as much as we do. Zoo bosses argue zoos are an important way of educating children. Of course, that's true. However, with the Internet and television documentaries, there are many other ways children can learn about animals. Zoos also argue they are necessary to save endangered species. That may be true too, but most of the animals in zoos are not in danger of extinction. I suppose zoos are OK if they only have endangered animals and breed them for the wild.",
      "answer": "動物園非常有趣，但我不確定我是否贊同它們的存在。我喜歡觀賞動物，但我總是為它們感到難過。它們通常看起來很憂鬱。大多數時候，它們都被關在狹小的籠子裡。它們一定很想念野外。我認為動物需要自由，和我們一樣重要。動物園的管理者辯稱，動物園是教育孩子的重要方式。當然，這是事實。然而，隨著互聯網和電視紀錄片的發展，孩子們還有許多其他方式可以了解動物。動物園還主張它們對於拯救瀕危物種是必要的。這也許是事實，但大多數動物園裡的動物並不面臨滅絕的危險。我想，如果動物園只收容瀕危動物並為它們繁殖以回歸野外，那麼動物園也許是可以接受的。",
