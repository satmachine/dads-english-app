      "question": "I wonder how many accidents I’ve had in my life. I’ve had a few serious ones where I’ve ended up in hospital. Traffic accidents are the worst. They’re always painful. I haven’t had too many work-related accidents. I suppose that’s because I do office work and that’s not so dangerous. Most of my accidents are those around the house. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve hit my thumb with a hammer. I’m also really good at standing up and hitting my head on something. I’m not as bad as my friend though. He’s a real accident looking for somewhere to happen. Almost every time we meet, he has some story to tell about his latest accident. He’s quite unbelievable. I think I’d be very worried if I were his mother.",
      "answer": "我不知道這輩子經歷過多少次意外。我曾經出過幾次嚴重的意外，最後都進了醫院。交通事故是最糟糕的，總是很痛苦。我沒有遇到太多工作相關的意外。我想那是因為我做的是辦公室工作，沒那麼危險。我大部分的意外都是在家裡發生的。我已經數不清有多少次用錘子敲到自己的拇指了。我也很擅長站起來時撞到頭。不過我沒有我朋友那麼糟。他簡直就是一個四處尋找意外的人。幾乎每次我們見面，他都有關於最新意外的故事要講。他真的很不可思議。如果我是他媽媽，我想我會非常擔心。",

Being a member of the audience at the theatre is great, but acting on stage is better. I wonder what it’s like to be a movie star. I think you need to be beautiful or handsome to be a successful Hollywood or Bollywood actor. They all look great. Actors are very lucky. They get paid huge amounts of money to do what they love doing. My favourite actors are all dead now. I really like the actors in the old black and white movies. They all looked so cool. Actors in the old days seemed to be more glamorous than today’s actors. The best thing about being an actor is that all of your friends are famous too.",
      "answer": "當演員一定很棒。我真希望我會演戲。我很想擁有在人們面前表演的自信。在劇院當觀眾已經很棒了，但在舞台上表演更好。我很好奇當電影明星是什麼感覺。我認為要成為成功的好萊塢或寶萊塢演員，你需要長得漂亮或英俊。他們看起來都很棒。演員們非常幸運。他們做自己喜歡的事情就能賺到大筆的錢。我最喜歡的演員現在都已經過世了。我真的很喜歡老黑白電影裡的演員。他們看起來都很酷。以前的演員似乎比現在的演員更有魅力。當演員最棒的事情是你所有的朋友也都很有名。",

      "question": "What is advertising? Is it telling the truth or is it making things look better than they really are? Or is it lying? Companies pay a lot of money for adverts. Some of the ads you see in glossy magazines look like art. The commercials on TV look like mini movies. Do they really change our behaviour? Do adverts make you buy things? I think some advertising is a form of lying. Is BMW really “The ultimate driving machine” like they say in their ads? British Airways used to say they were “The world’s favourite airline,” but had to stop saying it because it wasn’t true. Personally, I get tired of watching ads on television. They always interrupt a good programme. I like ads in magazines. They’re usually quite interesting.",
      "answer": "什麼是廣告？它是在說真話，還是在把事情描繪得比實際上更好？或者它是在說謊？公司為廣告付出大量的金錢。你在光面雜誌上看到的一些廣告看起來像藝術品。電視上的商業廣告看起來像迷你電影。它們真的會改變我們的行為嗎？廣告會讓你買東西嗎？我認為有些廣告是一種謊言。BMW真的像他們廣告說的那樣是「終極駕駛機器」嗎？英國航空公司曾經說他們是「世界上最受歡迎的航空公司」，但因為這不是真的，他們不得不停止這樣說。就我個人而言，我厭倦了看電視廣告。它們總是打斷好節目。我喜歡雜誌裡的廣告，通常都挺有趣的。",

Listening to advice can be great for helping you make the right decision. The greatest piece of advice I’ve received was from my father. He told me I can do anything in life if I try hard. He was right. I am now passing on his advice to my own children. Right now I need some advice on money. My financial advisors are telling me to be very careful. That’s very sound advice. I would advise anyone to do the same. Someone asked me the other day about the worst piece of advice I’ve ever had. I couldn’t answer. I don’t think I’ve had any really bad advice.",

I like playing with the in-flight entertainment system, especially now they have all the latest movies. I also love airplane food. Many of my friends say it’s disgusting, but I love it. I often ask the passenger next to me if I can have the dessert or roll they don’t want. The only thing I don’t like about planes is turbulence. When the airplane hits those air pockets, I always worry we’ll crash. But I once read that turbulence has never caused an airplane to crash.",

It seems like you walk across a town by the time you check in and get to your departure gate. The thing I like most about airports is people watching. There are people from all over the world. I also like how everything fits and works together. You check your luggage in and then it disappears, before you see it again at the next airport. I still think airports need improving. There’s not a lot to do there. Airports really need to have an entertainment area so people can kill time.",
      "answer": "機場不是很奇怪的地方嗎？裡面發生著這麼多事情。有人來，有人走；有人因為要離開而傷心哭泣，有人因為到達而喜極而泣。大型機場幾乎就像小城鎮。從辦理登機手續到到達登機門，感覺就像穿越了一個城鎮。我最喜歡機場的事情是觀察人群。那裡有來自世界各地的人。我也喜歡一切如何配合和運作。你托運行李，然後它消失了，直到你在下一個機場再次看到它。我仍然認為機場需要改進。那裡沒有太多事情可做。機場真的需要有一個娛樂區，讓人們可以打發時間。",

I drank when I was much younger, but I haven’t touched a drop for years. I hated hangovers so I decided to stop drinking altogether. I have a much better time without alcohol. people say they need to drink to relax. They drink and just act and look stupid. Their face goes red and they can’t walk in a straight line. Alcohol is also the most damaging drug in society. That’s what I think, anyway. Alcohol causes many illnesses, traffic accidents, fights and domestic violence. If you banned alcohol, people would be healthier, richer and have a better family life.",
      "answer": "我討厭酒精。我真的不理解人們怎麼會喝酒，或為什麼要喝酒。人們呼吸中的酒精味令人噁心。它很貴，還會讓你頭痛。我年輕時喝過酒，但已經好幾年滴酒未沾了。我討厭宿醉，所以決定完全戒酒。沒有酒精我過得更開心。人們說他們需要喝酒來放鬆。他們喝了酒後行為舉止看起來都很蠢。他們的臉變紅，走路都走不直。酒精也是社會中最具破壞性的毒品。反正這是我的看法。酒精會導致許多疾病、交通事故、打架和家庭暴力。如果你禁止酒精，人們會更健康、更富有，家庭生活也會更好。",

I also don’t think they look like us. But I’m sure they exist. I just don’t think we’ll ever see any or find any. They live too far away. If you think about it logically, there has to be aliens out there. All a planet needs is to be warm and have water and life will exist. There are billions and billions of planets in the universe, so there are probably millions and millions that have life. Alien life. It’s also likely that some of the aliens are much more intelligent than we are. I wonder what we’d do if really intelligent aliens visited Earth. What would we ask them?",

I knew all the different animal species. The most exciting thing for me was going to the zoo. I would spend hours just watching the animals walk around, sit, or even sleep. When I was older, I went on a safari to Tanzania. I saw real wild animals in the wild. Everyone should do this once in their lives. Looking at animals in their natural habitat is a real honour. Now I’m worried about the future of many animals. Some of my favourite animals are in danger of dying out. We really need to change our lifestyle so our children can have the chance of seeing animals in the wild.",

How is it possible for a cream or lotion to stop us looking old? I don't think any skincare goods can make us look younger. I certainly don't believe cosmetics companies that say their expensive creams can remove wrinkles. They just want to make lots of money. Why do people believe them? How do they know their creams work? They did not test their products on thousands of people over 50 years. I think if a person uses an anti-aging cream for 50 years, they would not even look a year younger when they are 60. This means it's a huge waste of money. Only healthy living can keep us looking younger.",

I don’t think it’s good for so many people to live so close together. It’s not good for people to live on top of each other. I don’t understand how people can live above the second floor. It’s not natural to live in the sky. The thing I hate most about apartments are the lifts (Americans say elevator) and the fact there’s no garden. More and more people are moving into apartments. This creates problems with overcrowding. There aren’t enough spaces to park your car, there’s nowhere to throw your rubbish and you have to wait ages to reach your floor. Give me a little house with a little garden any day.",
      "answer": "在美國，它們被稱為公寓（apartments）；在英國它們被稱為公寓（flats）。它們是現代的發明。我並不特別喜歡它們。我認為這麼多人住在一起不太好。人們住在彼此頭上不是件好事。我不明白人們怎麼能住在二樓以上。住在天空中是不自然的。我最討厭公寓的是電梯（英國人說lift，美國人說elevator）和沒有花園這個事實。越來越多的人搬進公寓。這造成了過度擁擠的問題。沒有足夠的停車位，沒有地方扔垃圾，而且你必須等很久才能到達你的樓層。隨時給我一棟帶小花園的小房子吧。",

I would like to fill my house with art from all over the world. It’s interesting to see how different cultures have different kinds of art. There’s nothing better than visiting art galleries when you go to another country. I prefer more traditional art. I don’t really understand a lot of modern art.

I love the changing of the leaves. The different autumn colours are one of nature’s most beautiful scenes. Sometimes I can’t stop looking at the mountains near my house. They are like an artist’s palette of golds, reds, yellows, browns and other autumnal colours. In America they call autumn ‘fall’ because that is when the leaves fall from the trees. I like the coolness of autumn. Summer is over but you can still wear a T-shirt – just about. You can also spend hours outdoors without sweating. Autumn is the best time of the year to go hiking and go for long walks.",

Why do we think some things or some people are beautiful and others aren’t? Some people think a building is beautiful, while others think the opposite. People nowadays spend too much time and money on beauty. I agree with the expression, “beauty is only skin deep”. This means that what’s really important is someone’s heart and character, not what they look like on the outside.

Of course, being married also has many wonderful sides to it. You have a lifelong friend who will love you forever. You share many wonderful times together and support each other through good and bad times. And you grow old together and look back on years of happy memories. I think being married is great for your soul.",

      "question": "Being single has its advantages and disadvantages. I think it’s better to stay single when you’re young. You need to live and have fun. You also need the freedom to do what you want, when you want. Being single in your twenties gives you lots of time to go travelling, see the world and experience different things. Most people like being single in their twenties and then want to settle down in their thirties. I think being single later in life can be sad. All of your friends are married or attached and people tend to go out and party less. I think being single when you’re old would be very lonely. The longer you stay single, the harder it becomes to settle down. In some countries, people think you’re strange if you’re single later on in life.",
      "answer": "單身有優點也有缺點。我認為年輕時最好保持單身。你需要生活和玩樂。你也需要自由，想做什麼就做什麼，想什麼時候做就什麼時候做。二十多歲時單身可以讓你有很多時間去旅行、看世界和體驗不同的事物。大多數人在二十多歲時喜歡單身，然後在三十多歲時想要安定下來。我認為人生後期單身可能會很悲傷。你所有的朋友都結婚了或有伴侶，人們外出和派對的次數也減少了。我認為老了以後單身會非常孤獨。你單身的時間越長，就越難安定下來。在一些國家，如果你在人生後期還是單身，人們會認為你很奇怪。",

I’m sure I’d be ten times busier than now if I didn’t have a computer. Imagine having to find a piece of paper and an envelope and then walking down the street to mail a letter! I love my computer. It makes everything in my life so convenient. Sure, it freezes and crashes sometimes. Sure I lose some data. But that’s not often. Most of the time my computer is like my best friend.",

      "question": "Would you like to change your face and body? Would you like movie star looks? A lot of people want to do this. They pay lots of money to go to a cosmetic surgeon and change their appearance. The most common operation we call a nose job. People who are unhappy with their nose have it reshaped. Other people want their wrinkles to disappear to make themselves look younger. People also go under the knife and have things made bigger or smaller. I think this is a waste of money. I'm not the best-looking person in the world but I would never consider plastic surgery - even if it was free. Some people have so many operations they end up looking like they’re  made of plastic. I'd rather stay looking human.",

The really expensive cosmetics don’t actually make you look that different than really cheap ones. A lot depends too on your skill – choosing the right colours to match your face, and how you put your make-up on. I sometimes laugh at the ladies selling cosmetics in department stores. They’re meant to be experts but they look like clowns. I mean, do they really need to paint their faces? One thing I worry about is whether the chemicals damage your skin.",

They keep you company, they bark if a stranger comes near your house, and they fetch your slippers. Not all dogs are nice, though. Some are dangerous. I get sad when I read in the paper about children being attacked by a dog. Owners need to train them better. I also get sad when I read about abandoned dogs. People who want a dog as a pet should get an abandoned one.",

Tuna is my favourite, especially raw tuna. When I visit Japan, the first thing I do is go to a sushi restaurant. Raw fish is so much tastier than cooked fish. And probably a lot healthier.",
      "answer": "魚是一種很健康的食物。它含有很多蛋白質和omega-3脂肪酸。醫生總是說我們應該多吃魚。我喜歡吃魚，特別是烤魚和蒸魚。我不太喜歡生魚，但我知道很多人喜歡壽司和生魚片。我小時候常常和我父親一起去釣魚。這是一個很好的方式來度過一個安靜的下午。釣到魚的感覺很棒，但我們通常會把魚放回水裡。我認為我們需要更加關注海洋環境。過度捕撈正在威脅很多魚類物種。如果我們不小心，未來可能就沒有魚可以吃了。",

To me, sitting next to a river waiting for something to happen is strange. I know lots of people who love fishing. They even get up at four o’clock in the morning in the winter to sit in the freezing cold. They say the best time to fish is before the sun comes up. I say they’re crazy. Big game fishing looks good.

Surely there are more important things to talk about. Gossip isn’t true. That’s why it’s gossip. OK, it might be true, but who cares? Gossiping is dangerous. It can make perfectly nice people look bad. I’m not sure if I’ve been the subject of gossip. I’m sure I wouldn’t like it if I was. I have some friends who buy gossip magazines. They love celebrity gossip. That’s even worse than office gossip. At least with office gossip you know the people. Any time someone comes to me to tell me the latest piece of “juicy gossip” or “hot gossip,” I tell them I’m not interested.",

She told me to look for patterns, but I’m not really sure what she means. She also told me one of the best ways to learn grammar is to read for pleasure.

A hangover is your body’s warning that too much alcohol is bad for you. When something is painful, you never do it again. Not so with a hangover. When people have a hangover, they often drink again the next day. This makes your original hangover much worse. Many people have their own hangover “cure”. None of them work for me.

It depends on what the government uses the information for. It also depends on how secure the database is that keeps our information. A lot of people think ID cards are too much. They think the government is trying to control us too much. I’m not sure that’s true, but it is something to think about. In this day and age, when immigration is a problem, I think ID cards might be useful. Some countries are using ID cards as a one-stop card for everything. The card is your driving license, medical card and ID all rolled into one. That’s a great idea. All we need now is to make it a passport and credit card.",

At election time, it is a major issue. Immigration today is big business. More and more people from poor countries want to live in rich countries. It is easier to travel nowadays because of cheap transport and more open borders. People risk their lives to get the chance of starting a new life in a rich country.

Someone has thought of a great idea, slogan and advertising campaign to sell us or tell us something. I like it when I can see the creativity. There are other kinds of marketing that make me angry. Ads and campaigns that are directed at children make my blood boil – especially the McDonalds ads that do not mention food, but show lots of free, cheap toys. I also hate viral marketing – that’s when you receive spam mail trying to sell you something.

If you love someone and want to stay together forever, why not get married? I think marriage adds a lot to a couple’s life, from the wedding day itself, right through to all of the anniversaries.

Many people from poor countries want to go to rich countries and become citizens. It’s strange because I don’t understand how your nationality can change. Even if I live in Peru for 50 years, I’m still English, even though I might have a Peruvian passport. I think people have confused feelings when they change nationalities. Their heart is still in their real country and not in the country of their new nationality. Nationality unfairly decides how successful you’ll be in life. If you’re born in a rich country, you’ll get a good education. If you’re born in a poor country, you might not even get basic human rights.",

It’s one of the most popular foods in the world. Spaghetti Bolognese and lasagna are now international dishes. What I don’t know is how many different types of pasta there are. Hundreds, I think; in all different shapes and colours. What I do know is that they are all delicious. Pasta is very versatile because it has so many uses.

      "question": "Pride is a funny thing. Sometimes it’s good. People should take pride in things they do well. It’s also OK to be proud of the people you love. I’m very proud of my children for many reasons. My proudest moment was when my son was born. Sometimes I’m proud of myself. When I’ve done something really difficult, I’m proud of myself. I recently lost a lot of weight so I’m quite proud of that. Last week I told my students I was proud of them. I think teachers are proud of their classes. Of course, there are times when pride is not so good. Sometimes people refuse to say sorry. They know they are wrong, but their pride stops them from apologizing. If more people swallowed their pride, we could get along better.",

We rarely had to give people our private information. Today, with the Internet and modern communications, privacy is a hot topic. It is now possible to steal someone’s identity. There are even websites that sell people’s private details. We have to be really careful with what we put online. Especially on social network sites. The private info you put on these is there for the whole world to see. It’s easy to search for someone’s name in Google and find out all kinds of stuff.

Actually, English teaching textbooks are pretty bad at teaching pronunciation. Look how many exercises there are – very few. And most of the exercises only teach one tiny point of pronunciation – word stress. And they don’t even show that the stress on a word changes in different sentences. I think pronunciation is very interesting. I wish all teachers used the phonemic symbols in every class. At least students could then improve their pronunciation with their dictionary.

Should prostitution be illegal? If a man or woman wants to sell his or her body, why not? Every government knows it happens in their country. Even countries with the strictest rules have prostitution. Many governments just turn a blind eye to it. The problem with making it illegal is that female prostitutes suffer. They have no legal protection and so their job becomes very dangerous. In Holland, prostitution is legal.

They worry about what they’ll do. I’m not worried at all. I know I can fill my days forever. Retirement is a time to do all the things you never had time to do because you were working. I have over 1,000 books on my reading list. I have hundreds of things to learn on the computer and lots of new hobbies. Early retirement for me would be 50. Most people retire at 60 or 65. I think 50 would be perfect. You’re still fit and healthy. You can still do lots of things. I wonder what it feels like to retire so young. To wake up every morning and never think about work.",

I could eat rice three times a day, but I don’t. I’m not sure if I could eat rice for breakfast. That’s because I’m English. Lunch and dinner are different, I can eat lots of rice then. The good thing about rice is that if you go to an Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Thai or Mexican restaurant, there’s rice on the menu. And it all tastes so different. Indian Basmati rice with curry is awesome; Japanese rice in sushi is heaven; and Thai rice is unbeatable.",

Some risks are simple, but potentially deadly. Do I run across the road now or wait for the green signal? Is it OK to eat this old fish? Other risks are more obvious, like when we invest money. The person in the bank even tells you about the risks and makes a risk profile of you. One financial manager told me I was a cautious risk taker, and then I invested in high-risk products. We can also take risks with our family and friends. Do you risk telling your mother you just broke her precious vase, or do you keep it a secret? Yes, risk is everywhere. It’s a part of life.",

Smoking is on the increase in countries like China and pretty much all over Africa. This is sad. Once people get enough information about the dangers of smoking, perhaps millions will quit this terrible habit.",

Summer is a time when we have picnics in the park and the sky is always blue. I go to the beach a lot in the summer and go hiking. It can never get too hot. I live in a country where summers are nice. I’m not sure if I could live somewhere where summers are unbearable. I like shopping for summer clothes. I usually wait until autumn when summer clothes are on sale. They’re not really in fashion for the next summer, but I don’t care. One thing I don’t understand about summer is summer holidays. Everyone I know goes to a warm country in the summer. That’s crazy. It’s warm here. Why not go to a warm country in the winter?",

One day it will die out because all the gas will be gone. But for today and perhaps the next 15 billion years, there’s enough gas to light and heat our part of the solar system. Scientists have been studying the sun for decades but know little about it. The problem is that few space probes can get too close to it.

In America, tax is lower but there’s almost no welfare system. Americans have to pay for their own healthcare. If you have no money or insurance, you can’t go to hospital.

I think everyone has a favourite taxi story. My best experience was with a Cairo taxi driver. I was late for a train. I told him I’d pay double if he could get me to the station in fifteen minutes.

I love planning trips and doing some research on the country or countries I want to visit. Sometimes I like to plan everything in advance, my flights, hotels and tours, etc. For me, the most exciting thing is arriving in a country with no hotel reservation and no fixed plans. I prefer staying in hostels and guest houses. You get to meet and talk to different and interesting people and share information. I also like to visit places that are off the beaten track. Being somewhere with thousands of other tourists? It’s not my cup of tea.",

Now, it’s a different matter about UFOs being space ships full of little green men. I’m not sure that’s true. I’m sure if aliens in space ships traveled all the way to Earth, they would pop in and say hello. I’m also sure that if there were UFOs flying around our galaxy, NASA telescopes could spot them. One day, our space ships will be UFOs and we’ll be the aliens.",

Some of us even want to learn thousands of words in another language. I wonder how many words we can remember. Thousands and thousands. But sometimes you don't need many. If someone says \"I want a few words with you\" I get worried.",

      "question": "I think writing is the most difficult skill in English. I'm not sure why. Some students are really good at speaking, but their writing is terrible. Why can't they just pretend they're speaking but write it all down. You certainly have more time to think when you write. I think writing has got easier in recent years. Computers and the Internet have helped us. Although I think many teachers would say technology is not a help. But it's true. We have spellcheckers when we type. They even warn us if we've made a mistake with grammar. There is also translation software, but that can produce gobbledygook. And then there are new places to write. With mobile phones and sites like Twitter you don't have a lot of space to write.",

      "question": "Do you like doing writing activities in class? I think they're quite interesting. It's not really like writing. The way we write in my language is different from English. The sentence and paragraph structures are different. My teacher gives us fun activities so we can do writing a bit at a time. Sometimes we brainstorm and write, sometimes we speed write for ten minutes. One of my favourite activities is writing in pairs. We have to agree on what to write. We even have to agree on the spelling and punctuation. That makes us think about the best way. I think this is very good for me. I also like doing online writing activities. It's good to help me practice typing. I need more writing activities.",

      "question": "X-rays are amazing things. They were invented a really long time ago. I think when they were invented, they were real, cutting edge technology. I think a lot of people were amazed they could see photos of the inside of their body. So OK, it's only photos of bones, but still, that was pretty high-tech fifty years ago. Today, we all have X-rays. Even when we go to the dentist, we have X-rays taken of our teeth. Of course, X-rays are not just used in hospitals. Every time we go to an airport we have to pass through an X-ray machine. The security guys can check to see if we have anything dangerous. Recently, I have seen X-ray machines in all kinds of places – even hotels. I even heard they are in schools.",

      "question": "Xenophobia is a strange word. For a start, it starts with an 'x' but the first sound is 'z'. It also looks strange. But it is a very serious word. There is too much xenophobia in the world today. There is no need for people to fear foreigners. We are all pretty much the same. The world is getting smaller, so we need to learn to live with our neighbours. I can understand why people were xenophobic. Most countries had a long history of fighting wars against their neighbours, so it was probably natural that people didn't like them. Today, however, it seems crazy that you would not like your neighbour, or people on the other side of the world. I hope that within another generation, xenophobia will be a forgotten word.",

      "question": "I like the word 'yes'. I much prefer hearing it than hearing 'no'. Yes is a very positive word. It means things can go ahead. You always hope the answer will be yes when you ask a question. The biggest question I asked was when I proposed to my wife. I was so happy when she said yes. Other times I like hearing this word is if I ask an interviewer if I got the job. I often say yes when I'm really happy or have done something really difficult. Even if I play a good shot at tennis I say 'yes' to myself. Even though it is a short word, it has many meanings depending on how you say it. You can express so many different emotions using just this word. Sometimes, 'yes' can mean 'no'. I think I say yes more than I say no.",

      "question": "People complain a lot about youth, about young people. I think they have for the past 60 years or so. I don't think youth was much of an issue a hundred years ago. Then, young people were just young people. They respected older people, did what they were told and didn't create trouble. Today, however, the word 'youth' often makes us think of badly behaved teenagers. I think it all started with rock and roll. Suddenly young people decided they wanted more independence and could do what they wanted. They rebelled against society. A whole youth culture developed, with youth fashion, youth clubs and music. Today, we have things like youth crime. It would be nice if youth could have a more positive image.",

Most of the time they are in tiny cages. They must miss the wild. I think animals need freedom as much as we do. Zoo bosses argue zoos are an important way of educating children. Of course, that's true. However, with the Internet and television documentaries, there are many other ways children can learn about animals. Zoos also argue they are necessary to save endangered species. That may be true too, but most of the animals in zoos are not in danger of extinction. I suppose zoos are OK if they only have endangered animals and breed them for the wild.",
