I haven’t had too many work-related accidents. I suppose that’s because I do office work and that’s not so dangerous. Most of my accidents are those around the house. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve hit my thumb with a hammer. I’m also really good at standing up and hitting my head on something. I’m not as bad as my friend though. He’s a real accident looking for somewhere to happen. Almost every time we meet, he has some story to tell about his latest accident. He’s quite unbelievable. I think I’d be very worried if I were his mother.",

I think you need to be beautiful or handsome to be a successful Hollywood or Bollywood actor. They all look great. Actors are very lucky. They get paid huge amounts of money to do what they love doing. My favourite actors are all dead now. I really like the actors in the old black and white movies. They all looked so cool. Actors in the old days seemed to be more glamorous than today’s actors. The best thing about being an actor is that all of your friends are famous too.",

Some of the ads you see in glossy magazines look like art. The commercials on TV look like mini movies. Do they really change our behaviour? Do adverts make you buy things? I think some advertising is a form of lying. Is BMW really “The ultimate driving machine” like they say in their ads? British Airways used to say they were “The world’s favourite airline,” but had to stop saying it because it wasn’t true. Personally, I get tired of watching ads on television.

I often ask the passenger next to me if I can have the dessert or roll they don’t want. The only thing I don’t like about planes is turbulence.

It seems like you walk across a town by the time you check in and get to your departure gate. The thing I like most about airports is people watching. There are people from all over the world. I also like how everything fits and works together. You check your luggage in and then it disappears, before you see it again at the next airport. I still think airports need improving.

There are billions and billions of planets in the universe, so there are probably millions and millions that have life. Alien life.

How is it possible for a cream or lotion to stop us looking old? I don't think any skincare goods can make us look younger. I certainly don't believe cosmetics companies that say their expensive creams can remove wrinkles. They just want to make lots of money. Why do people believe them? How do they know their creams work? They did not test their products on thousands of people over 50 years. I think if a person uses an anti-aging cream for 50 years, they would not even look a year younger when they are 60. This means it's a huge waste of money.

It’s not natural to live in the sky. The thing I hate most about apartments are the lifts (Americans say elevator) and the fact there’s no garden. More and more people are moving into apartments.

They are like an artist’s palette of golds, reds, yellows, browns and other autumnal colours. In America they call autumn ‘fall’ because that is when the leaves fall from the trees.

When I was even younger, I liked it when my babysitter came round. She would always play games with us and let us stay up late. She would send us to bed just before my parents came home. I know in some countries, babysitting isn’t so common. It isn’t part of the culture. I suppose that’s not such a bad thing.

People nowadays spend too much time and money on beauty. I agree with the expression, “beauty is only skin deep”.

Making them chase a piece of string or a beam of light is very funny, indeed. But a drawback of having a cat is that they can be too talkative. My cat always meows when she wants to eat. And she tries to make us give her our food when we are eating, especially when we are having fish for dinner. On the order hand, owning a cat has its advantages. For example, they catch mice and other small animals. For cats, catching and giving small animals to their owners is a sign of generosity. Sometimes my cat brings animals who are not dead into the house. I really don't like it when she does that.",

Chickens are also cute. Well, chickens aren’t, but chicks are - cute, fluffy chicks that make everyone go ‘aaahh’. It’s strange though that the word ‘chicken’ is used in so many English idioms. When I was at high school, you couldn’t ‘chicken out’ – to not do something because of being scared. Things are different today - I’m no spring chicken (that means I’m no longer young) so no one calls me a chicken any more. I work now - as a teacher. I get chicken feed (low wages) but I like my job. I plan to retire before I’m 50, but I’m not going to count my chickens before they’re hatched. This means I won’t quit working until I have enough money.",

Everything about a funeral makes me cry. When I open the invitation, tears well up in my eyes. When I see the funeral procession drive by, I start. The actual ceremony is almost unbearable. I have never learnt to control my sobs. If you hear someone sniffing non –stop, that’s me. The music at funerals is unnecessarily sad. I’ve told my friends I want salsa music at my funeral. And I don’t want people to wear black. I also hope the party after the funeral isn’t a sad occasion. People should laugh and remember the funny times.",

It’s difficult to believe that heaven is a place that looks like paradise. Pretty much every religion in the world believes that heaven is real. I don’t think it’s full of angels with wings though. I think there are lots of heavenly places on Earth. Anywhere in the countryside is heaven to me. Sitting on a beach with blue skies is also heaven. You can even be in heaven in the city. Walking into a cool, air-conditioned building from a hot, sweaty street is heaven. I also find heaven in food. A double chocolate fudge and nut ice cream with maple syrup and extra whipped cream is simply heaven.",

I think if all the world’s money was shared out, the world would go round more happily, and there would be less evil and more happiness.",

Neil Armstrong walking on the Moon’s surface must be the greatest human achievement ever. Even though man has walked on the Moon, not everyone agrees on its colour. In Japan, and perhaps in other countries too, they think it’s yellow. Of course, the Moon is white. One day, we’ll probably have holidays on the Moon. I’d totally love that.

I’m hoping old age will be nice. It seems a time when you can relax and slow down. If course, you have to slow down because your body wears out. There are two things I’m worried about. One is money. I think if you are old and poor, you’ll be miserable. No money to enjoy yourself. Maybe not even enough money to eat, pay bills or go to the hospital. That’s scary. The other thing I worry about is being in good health. Especially my mental health. I imagine I’ll be happy in my old age. I have so many hobbies and I know I’ll enjoy doing them all every day.",

Mercury is just a red, hot ball, pretty much the same as Mars. Saturn looks like a real planet. Its rings give it an extra-special look. The other planets don’t look that interesting. I don’t really know much about Venus, Neptune, Uranus and Jupiter. When I was at school, we learnt that Pluto was a planet. But now it isn’t.

      "question": "Racism should be decreasing around the world, but it isn’t. I think it’s getting worse. It really is one of the worst things in the world. It’s totally illogical and disgusting. How can you hate someone because of the colour of their skin. I know many horrible people who have my skin colour and many beautiful people with different skin colours. I remember at school hearing racist words said to someone. I felt sorry for him. He was the only non-white person in the whole school. I never understood where the hate came from. Racism never leads to anything positive. Accepting people from other races, and religions and cultures, can only bring many positives to the world.

I watched cartoons and other kids’ shows non-stop. It was good at the time, but maybe I should have been outside playing or doing something more useful. There’s a lot of rubbish on TV. There are so many programmes that you watch just because you’re too lazy to do something useful. A lot of people turn on the TV and sit in front of it all day or all night. What a waste of time! I think television programmes are getting worse. Reality TV and celebrity chat shows are the worst. The only good things on TV nowadays is the news, live sport and comedy shows.

      "question": "War is the worst thing in the world. I've never experienced it. I've never seen it. I never want to. Just looking at it on television is enough. What is war? It's when leaders think they have to be strong so they attack another country and kill more civilians than soldiers. That's war today. Generals and presidents always apologize for the loss of innocent lives, but their image as a strong man (or woman) is more important than the suffering and misery their decisions lead to. There are many examples of wars ending or being avoided through talking. But then talking doesn't feed the war machine. Lots of people get rich when their country goes to war. And we learn in our history books that we are \"good\" at war, so it's OK.",

They then make them into monsters and say they are guilty of terrible war crimes. This is probably true. They are guilty of war crimes. The strange thing is, countries like America and Britain can attack other countries and kill thousands of innocent civilians but no one is a war criminal. Hundreds of people can die in a bombing and their leaders call it \"collateral damage\" or an accident. I think we need to look again at what a war crime is. If a major world power drops a bomb on my house by mistake, someone must be responsible for that.",

I was dreaming about drinking cool water. And when I came to a small river, the water was delicious. And cool. But that was years ago. I think the water in that river is polluted today and dangerous to drink. That's sad. When I was a kid, water was fun. You could splash around in it and drink it in the countryside. Not today though. Water is becoming more and more precious. In fact, there will soon be wars over water. We really need to start thinking more about water and how we can conserve it.
